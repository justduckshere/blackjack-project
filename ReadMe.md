Please note I have been using a MAC machine for the below commands.

To build and run (from root):
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh


To run the rests(from root):
chmod +x test.sh
./test.sh


I have temporarily placed the blackjack-project executable in the root directory so that it is easier to find, but normally it is redirected to the /build folder.
